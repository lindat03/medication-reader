## Inspiration
The inspiration behind Shifa comes from the desire to simplify medication management for the elderly and individuals who may struggle with deciphering medical labels and understanding complex prescription instructions. We recognized the need to leverage technology to improve medication adherence and enhance understanding of medication details.

## What it does
Shifa is an innovative application that uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to extract text from prescription labels and medical pill bottles. It then utilizes the OpenAI API to generate simple and straightforward descriptions of the medication and its uses. This means that Shifa takes the complicated jargon often found on medication labels and translates it into easily understandable language.

The primary function of Shifa is to help the elderly and anyone managing multiple medications to stay organized and informed about their treatment. It simplifies the process of medication management, ensuring that users have a clear understanding of what each medication is for and how to take it.

## How we built it
- **OCR**: We integrated an OCR package to scan and extract text from images of medical pill bottles and prescription labels.
- **OpenAI API**: We prompt-engineered the davinci model from the OpenAI API to parse through the extracted OCR text and generate simplified descriptions of the medication and its uses.
- **React**: We used React to create an intuitive and user-friendly frontend interface. This allows users to easily interact with the application and receive the information they need.
- **Flask**: Flask was employed to link the OCR and OpenAI backend with the React frontend, ensuring seamless communication and functionality.

## Challenges we ran into
- **OCR Accuracy**: Ensuring accurate text extraction from images posed a significant challenge, as prescription labels and pill bottles can vary in appearance and quality.
- **Integration**: Integrating multiple technologies and ensuring they work together smoothly required careful planning and testing.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Successfully implementing OCR technology to extract text from medical labels and bottles.
- Developing a robust davinci model through prompt-engineering and parsing algorithms that can convert complex medical information into user-friendly language.
- Creating an easy-to-use and visually appealing frontend with React.
- Building a functional and reliable application that has the potential to significantly improve medication management for the elderly.

## What we learned
- The challenges and complexities of working with OCR technology.
- The power of NLP in making complex medical information accessible to a wider audience.
- The importance of user-friendly design and interface in healthcare applications.
- The potential impact of technology in improving the lives of seniors and individuals with complex medication regimens.


## What's next for Shifa
The future of Shifa holds exciting possibilities, and we have designed a Figma demo to present these future enhancements.

- **Enhanced Accuracy**: We aim to improve the accuracy of text extraction from images through further refinement of the OCR technology.
- **Expanded Medication Database**: Shifa can be enhanced by incorporating a comprehensive database of medications, providing users with more detailed information about their prescriptions.
- **Personalized Reminders**: Implementing medication reminder features to help users stay on track with their treatment plans.
- **Integration with Healthcare Providers**: Exploring options to connect Shifa with healthcare providers to ensure seamless communication and medication management.
- **Mobile App**: Developing a mobile version of Shifa for even greater accessibility and convenience.
- **Medication Scheduling**: Introducing a calendar feature that allows users to schedule when medications need to be taken. This feature will provide timely reminders, ensuring that users never miss a dose and helping them adhere to their treatment plans more effectively.
